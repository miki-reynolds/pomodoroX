### ≧❀‿❀≦ Inspiration & Design:
_A brief summary_ <br />
This extension idea came to me around the time when I incorporated Notion into my time management and organization to better assist me with both full-time job, CS school and programming in my free time.
Initially, I used an embedded Notion widget to track my time usage, which worked for a short period of time 
before I became more frustrated with the fact that I had to switched back and forth between pages to see the remaining time for a task.
<br /><br />
This frustration along with a lack of personalization options has inspired me to build my own Pomodoro application. 
The ability to customize plays a pivotal role in motivating users, including me, and encouraging the frequent usage of the application.
I decided to go with Chrome Extension as it allows synchronicity no matter what website users are on, they can always see my timer easily!
<br /> <br />
As introduced in my README, I'm a cuteness lover and a manga-and-anime fan, so the default design and icon of the application are inspired by the character named
Shoto in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Hero_Academia">Boku No Hero Academia</a>.
Shoto has both "fire and ice" elements within himself 
just as Pomodoro has the <b>cool-down</b> periods (long breaks), <b>transitional</b> periods (short breaks) and <b>fire</b> periods (pomodoro main chunks, usually 25 minutes).
